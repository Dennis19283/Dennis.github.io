                        <p>Hello, my name is Dennis Spencer Turandi, an Undergraduate Student at <a href="https://www.nuist.edu.cn/main.htm" target="_blank">Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology</a> in Nanjing, China.</p>
                        <p class="text-space">My first interest in programming came while I was in high school in 2019. At the time, I noticed that the technological trend was fast developing because many problems could be handled using existing technology, which piqued my curiosity in the area of programming. After several years of studying in the field of technology, I've used several programming languages to solve problems and create projects, including Javascript, Python, and Java.</p>
                        <p class="text-space">Furthermore, I am interested in emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning Development, Computer Vision, Web Development, Cybersecurity, and DevOps. In addition, I am passionate about music, business, sports, and economics.</p>

                        <p>I started teaching students who wanted to learn Chinese in January 2020. I contributed to becoming an assistant teacher. I had never before instructed someone else in the Chinese Language, thus this was a fantastic experience for me. .<br><br>For the first time, I know how to interact with pupils and educate them in a way that helps them grasp. To make education simpler and more enjoyable for students, we must be inventive.<br></p>

                        <p>On June 21 2021, I took part in a competition held by Alam Sehat Lestari (ASRI) in remembrance of Earth Day, which is honored on April 22, and World Forest Day, which is observed on March 21.<br><br> By participating in this competition, I became aware of how challenging it is to create music and a music video (MV). All of the following are necessary for advance: concept, music production, editing, and finalization. I now have a lot more regard for folks who work in the music industry as a result of this.<br><br><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s9DafRCCLCrLiAOeAVoL2JyZ5kdFVK2H/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Here's my cover song</a></p>
